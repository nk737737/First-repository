        <p>This is a stunning ancient city founded <strong>by the Etruscans 2,500 years ago.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The city is called <strong>"dying"</strong>. An earthquake in the 17th century began the erosion of the mountain on which the city stands. It started to collapse. There are currently 11 permanent residents here. In the 19th century, the city became an <strong>"island"</strong>. The erosion processes have accelerated. According to forecasts, the city will disappear in 2 centuries.</p>
      
        <p><strong>How to get to the city:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>By car</li>
            <li>On a regular bus</li>
            <li>Take a guided tour with a group</li>
        </ul>

      <p>The city is notable for its picturesque location on a plateau of friable volcanic tuff overlooking the valley of the Tiber River. It is constantly under threat of destruction, as the edges of the plateau continue to collapse, leading to the collapse of buildings and the destruction of their foundations. Since 2004, it has been planned to strengthen the plateau with steel rods to prevent further geological damage.</p>

      <p>In Civita, especially in the area of San Francesco Vecchio, there are many traces of Etruscan civilization: a small Etruscan necropolis was found in a rock located below the Belvedere of San Francesco Vecchio. The Cave of Saint Bonaventure (where Saint Francis is said to have healed little Giovanni Fidanza, who later became Saint Bonaventure) is also an Etruscan chamber tomb.</p>
